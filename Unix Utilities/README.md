In this repository, I implemented some UNIX utilities:

1. cat utility, create or open exiting file and print its content in stdout.

2. Pwd utility, print current working directory.

3. Echo utility, print arguments in stdout.

4. cp utility, copy file to existing file or create new file.

5. mv utility, move file to another destination or rename.
